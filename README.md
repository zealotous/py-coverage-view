# py-coverage-view README

Highlights test covered python code on the editor. This extension uses the results of pytest-cov/coverage.py (.coverage by default) to highlight covered code.


## Features
- Highlights uncovered(default) or covered code (set via settings).
- Displays coverage stats and highlight mode in the IDE status bar.


## Requirements

The extension requires the following modules on your python environment.

* Install pytest and pytest-cov
```
pip install pytest pytest-cov
```

Generate coverage statistics in JSON format
```
# Run tests and generate coverage
pytest --cov=. 
coverate json --pritty-print
```

## Extension Settings

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `python.coveragepy.file`: The coverage.py internal file for saving coverage results.
* `python.coverageView.highlight`: Highlight color.
* `python.coverageView.highlightMode`: Highlight mode: ```uncovered```(default) or ```covered```.

## Known Issues

TODO:
- Use `missing_lines` and `covered_lines` to highlight covered/uncovered lines.
- Set coverage.json as a default fallback for coverage files.
- Generate `coverage json` automatically on .coverage change.
